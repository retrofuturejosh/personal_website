        Simply put, as a classically trained theatre artist and operatic vocalist, I aim to bring life to words. More specifically, I draw on my knowledge of resonance, tone, character, diction, and dialects to bring a greater depth of understanding to written copy. My past work with educational organizations & advertisers combined with extensive experience in dramatized speech make me a versatile and informed voice artist, able to accommodate a wide range of client needs.
