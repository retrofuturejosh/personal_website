        Greetings! Iâ€™m a full stack software engineer motivated by novel challenges, elegant design, and clean code. I recently graduated from Fullstack Academy with a fellowship through the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline. While at Fullstack, I developed advanced technical skills in a Node.js, Express, React/Redux, Sequelize tech stack. I previously worked as a music producer and audio engineer in a professional recording studio, where I consistently delivered a stellar product while nurturing positive client relationships. I am excited to continue honing and expanding my technical skills while building a career as a software engineer.
