        Greetings! Iâ€™m a full stack software engineer and endlessly curious problem solver motivated by novel challenges, elegant design, and clean code. I attended Fullstack Academy with a full scholarship through the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline. Before starting my career as a software engineer, I worked as a music producer and audio engineer in a professional recording studio, where I consistently delivered a stellar product while nurturing positive client relationships. I am currently looking for a full time software engineer position at a company with a great product and excellent culture.
